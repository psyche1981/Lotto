# Lotto - a test project to help build upon what ive learned in c++ so far

A random number generator that prints out the 6 most frequent "balls" generated.
Want to have it eventually be used for lottos where a different number of balls are in the hat and also where a
different number of balls are pulled out of the hat - all to be determined by the user.
